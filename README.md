# My Filter Function

This project demonstrates how to use a higher-order function in JavaScript to filter words based on a specific condition. The program filters an array of words and displays only those that have exactly six letters. The result is displayed directly on the webpage.

## Features

- Filters an array of words to include only those with exactly six letters.
- Displays the filtered words on the webpage, dynamically updating the content.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For creating the structure of the page.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the filtering logic and manipulating the DOM to display the result.
- **Git**: For version control and managing the project.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Abdulrahman843/my-filter-function.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd my-filter-function
    ```

3. **Open the `index.html` file in your browser**:
    You can open the file by double-clicking it or using the following command depending on your operating system:
    - **Windows**: `start index.html`
    - **macOS**: `open index.html`
    - **Linux**: `xdg-open index.html`

4. **View the filtered results**:
    The filtered words will be displayed on the webpage under the heading "Filtered Words".
